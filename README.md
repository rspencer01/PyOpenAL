# PyOpenAL

PyOpenAL provides OpenAL bindings for python as well as an interface to them.

It also provides a simple way to play WAVE and even OGG Vorbis and OGG Opus files, the latter two if used together with [PyOgg](https://github.com/Zuzu-Typ/PyOgg).

You can install it using the PyPI:

	pip install PyOpenAL

	
PyOpenAL requires a dynamic OpenAL library (e.g. OpenAL32.dll). 
You can use the [official OpenAL library](http://www.openal.org/) (deprecated) or the much better sounding [OpenAL Soft library](http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html), which is still actively developed (or any other OpenAL compatible library).

PyOpenAL provides OpenAL bindings, as you would find them in C++, meaning you can follow any [OpenAL C++ tutorial](http://www.openal.org/documentation/) with Python.
OpenAL's methods expect C types as arguments, which means you will have to convert Python's types to C types using [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) if you want to use them directly.
Don't worry though, PyOpenAL can be used without the need to do that.

I removed the support for ALUT, because it is basically impossible to build nowadays. If you want ALUT support, please use the original [PyOpenAL from forrestv](https://github.com/forrestv/PyOpenAL)

### Examples
##### Playing a wave file

	# import PyOpenAL (will require an OpenAL library)
	from openal import * 
	
	# import the time module, for sleeping during playback
	import time

	# open our wave file
	source = oalOpen("test.wav")

	# and start playback
	source.play()

	# check if the file is still playing
	while source.get_state() == AL_PLAYING:
		# wait until the file is done playing
		time.sleep(1)
		
	# release resources (don't forget this)
	oalQuit()
	
##### Playing an OGG Opus file (with PyOgg)

	from openal import * 
	
	# even though we use PyOgg, we don't have to import it ourselves, 
	# PyOpenAL does that for us (if it can find it)
	
	import time
	
	source = oalOpen("test.opus")

	source.play()

	while source.get_state() == AL_PLAYING:
		time.sleep(1)
		
	# remember, don't forget to quit
	oalQuit()
		
##### Streaming a file

	from openal import *

	# here we define how much data is supposed to be held at a time (for Vorbis and Opus files), in how many buffers
	# this is set automatically, but you can set it yourself, if you can't update the stream frequently enough
	pyoggSetStreamBufferSize(4096*4)
	oalSetStreamBufferCount(4)

	sourceStream = oalStream("test.ogg")

	sourceStream.play()

	while sourceStream.get_state() == AL_PLAYING:
		# do stuff
		[...]
		
		# update the stream (load new data)
		# if you don't do this repeatedly, the stream will suffocate
		sourceStream.update()
		
	oalQuit()
	
### Using OpenAL functions

	# here we only import OpenAL's functions 
	# (in case you don't need / want PyOpenAL's functions / classes)
	from openal._al import *
	from openal._alc import *

	[...]
	
	# it's as simple as that:
	alDistanceModel(AL_INVERSE_DISTANCE_CLAMPED)
	
	# or a little more complicated, it really depends:
	alSourceUnqueueBuffers(source_id, 1, ctypes.pointer(ctypes.c_uint(buffer_ids[id])))
	
	[...]
